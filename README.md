# Predicting Log Error in Zillow Home Values


## Goal

The goal is to create a model using clustering methodologies to better predict the logerror in the current Zestimate on Zillow.

The log error is defined as logerror=log(Zestimate)âˆ’log(SalePrice)

## Project Steps

### Acquire

The Acquire.py module contains several functions:
- Sets up the connection to the MySQL database where the data is stored.
- Acquires the Zillow data according to a SQL statement.
- Caches the acquired data locally to speed up processing.

### Prepare

The Prepare.py module:
- removes nulls in columns/rows
- removes outliers
- creates new columns
- splits into train, validate, test

### Explore

The Explore.py module:
- Once the data is split, explore on train.
- SQFT with Hypothesis Testing
- Bathroom Count with Hypothesis Testing
- Bedroom Count with Hypothesis Testing

### Model

Baseline model was based on the average log error and had a RMSE score of 0.1717
Final model chosen was a Polynomial Linear Regression with degree=3 on the top 9 features from SelectKBest.

Train RMSE: 0.0148
Validate RMSE: 0.1701
Test RMSE: 0.1838

### Conclusion

Clusters and features explored did not have a significant difference with respect to log error. More exploration is needed to determine if other clusters can be created.
